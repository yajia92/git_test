        <li>Add Knorr Pork Cubes, stir well to dissolve before adding the tomato paste and tomato sauce. Just sauté this for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, add sugar, pepper and water and continue to simmer over medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes until sauce has slightly thickened. Give this a nice seasoning of salt. You can add more sugar if preferred. You can also use the remaining pasta water to add starch and body to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Now comes the best part! Get a big platter ready for your cooked spaghetti noodles and pour the sauce on top with a sprinkle of grated cheese. And that’s our dish!</li>
