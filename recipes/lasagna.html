     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><em>Meat:</em> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><em>Onion and garlic:</em> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>    
        <li><em>Tomato products:</em> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><em>Sugar:</em> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><em>Spices and seasonings:</em> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><em>Lasagna noodles:</em> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><em>Cheeses:</em> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><em>Egg:</em> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>        
             
     </ul>
